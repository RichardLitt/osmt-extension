Open Source Metatags Extension 
==============================

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/RichardLitt/osmt-extension.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a Chrome extension to check for OSMT compliant websites. If a site has the correct `os` tags, it will log them. 

Eventually a way of automatically going to a site would be ideal.
