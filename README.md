Drought.js
============

This is a Chrome extension to get rid of the distracting bits of
Facebook, while still allowing you to talk to the few friends you were
already talking to. Optionally, you can include the list of friends
online, by hiding the Facebook chat bar (clicking in the lower right
corner.) Or you can comment out the code, if you're keen on js.  

I did this as an experiment, before I knew JS, so it's not perfect. Could be done a lot better in jQuery, most likely. There's some weird issue I haven't solved yet with the cover - if you've got a solution that is pure javascript, let me know. This is why there are multiple folders.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

To install: 

 * Download the appropriate drought folder, or just fork the whole repo. 
 * Go to chrome://extensions in the browser, and click "Load unpacked extensions...". 
 * Load the folder in.
 * Enable or disable as desired, when desired. This makes it harder than a simple button would.
 * Go to Facebook. 
 * Press refresh.  
 * Enjoy.
